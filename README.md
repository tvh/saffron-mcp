## ðŸ¤– Setting up Claude

If you haven't setup MCP before, [first read more about how to install Claude Desktop client & configure an MCP server.](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

To add `saffron-mcp` to Claude, all you need to do is create another entry in the `mcpServers` section of your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "saffron": {
      "key": "saffron",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "tsx",
        "/path/to/saffron-mcp/src/index.ts",
        "--email",
        "<your email>",
        "--password",
        "<your password>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude and you should see the MCP server tools after clicking on the hammerhead icon:
